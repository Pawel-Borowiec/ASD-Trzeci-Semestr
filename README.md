# ASD-Third semester
Expanded programming task from third semester of studies. To  fullfill requirements of ths task I had to implement pathfinding algorithm to 2d randomly generated board. Later on I added to these program GUI made in JAVAFX to remind myself this framework and update code to make it easier to read.

Now program allow user to generate 10x10 board with to type of tiles ( Avalaible and unavalaible ) and choose starting point and ending point. Then program will generete list of visited  tiles and show path from starting point to ending point ( if exist valid path beetwem them )
